## Info

Hi, I'm just a university student who plays [MapleStory](https://maplestory.nexon.net/) sometimes. I made this to keep track of things I need to do and to practice my website coding.

## Included in website

### Dailies
- Maple Guide daily bosses
- Arcane River daily quests and party quests
- Fairy Bros daily gift
- Legion coins
- Ursus and Maple Tour
- Commerci trades
- Monster Park
- Yu Garden daily quests
- Phantom Forest daily quests

### Weeklies
- Maple Guide weekly bosses
- Deia's G Potion
- Scrapyard and Dark World Tree
- Kritias

## To be Implemented
- store info in browser so it won't reset on page reload

## Assets
All MapleStory assets were taken from the game, and I have no ownership over them.
Some assets have had minor edits made to them using [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

Maple Journal logo was created by me in Photoshop by editing the Maplestory Logo with text using Seoul Hangang font.
