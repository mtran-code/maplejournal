## Info

Hi, I'm just a university student who plays [MapleStory](https://maplestory.nexon.net/) sometimes. I made this to keep track of things I need to do and to practice my website coding.

## Assets
All MapleStory assets were taken from the game, and I have no ownership over them.
Some assets have had minor edits made to them using [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

Maple Journal logo was created by me in Photoshop by editing the Maplestory Logo with text using Seoul Hangang font.
